Currently only the Spanish language project is fully translated with the correct strings. 
Also, as new features are added, that will be the first language updated, as it's the second language I became fluent in over the years, and easiest for me to translate.

If you download those files, you can change the Spanish translations to your native language, leaving the English part how it is, and then create a pull request on here for your language using the edited file(s), or upload the corrected file(s) and send it to me on Twitter @BrianVS

FolderController.strings is the main file for the first page, and only needs strings that are on that page(The ones that are in spanish project es.lproj).  Extras won't hurt though.
I actually just made the file shorter and saved it as FolderControllerFirstPage.strings 
That has only the strings needed for first/ main page.

I did the same with CustomLayouts for easier translating. Just change Spanish to your language.

If you don't see your native language on here, you can fork the repo and create a folder with the corresponding abbreviation.lproj and add the strings in there.
I will give credit in the about section of the tweak that includes a link to your Twitter, if desired.  Any questions or concerns feel free to contact me on Twitter @BrianVS



Apologies that the files have some extra phrases and other redundancies; the tweak was totally restructured and I did a lot of copy pasting of older translations, and have been more focused on the tweak itself then the translations.
I will definitely add any new languages sent to me or forked on here, though.
