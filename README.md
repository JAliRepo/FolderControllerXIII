# FolderControllerXIII
A work in progress tweak aiming to provide full custom layouts of folders, homescreen and dock icons, plus adding all the options for customization of folders in FolderControllerXII, as well as countless other useful features. 

This is an all-in-one custom layout tweak, meant to eliminate the need for any conflicting packages like HomePlus or Boxy.
At this point the tweak is finished and stable, all that is left is translations.  I found headers that will allow me to add lots of other neat otions no one else has done yet on iOS 13 or any other firmware, but I will implement them after releasing the current version in Packix.

Tweak is currently only available for sale in YouRepo for $1.50 Http://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com/pack/foldercontrollerxiii 

It will be $1.99 when finished and in Packix, but half price for anyone that bought FolderControllerXII. I hope to release this very soon, and continue updating once the original release is available to everyone.

Unfortuneately due to multiple people using methods from FolderControllerXII, learning from them, and making new copycat tweaks for folders, I do not plan on open sourcing this project.  It's really sad that you can't show your best work because of copy-paste "developers", and pirates eager to profit off the hundreds of hours I put into this project, but that's life. You live, you learn, and then make sure you DON'T share what you learn until it's no longer relevant.

Translators making significant contributions to the tweak will be gifted copies so they can better understand the settings, and re-word them when needed.  I focused most on the functionality of the tweak, and less on making the strings crystal clear for people that haven't used the tweak.  Hit me up on Twitter @BrianVS if you would like to add a translation or make a correction to an existing one, or if you have a question about what a particular setting is for.
